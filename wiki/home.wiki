= XMLTV2Mediastar-EPG =

This project started with a single Perl script that converts XMLTV data to
the EPG (electronic programme guide) data file format used by the Mediastar 
DT-920PVR, DT-820PVR and Arion 9300 PVR. Windows users may want to first try the
[http://pvr-tools.com/ PVR-Tools converter] (Win-32 executable - easier to install).

The Perl script requires the following pre-requisites:

  * Perl 5.6 or later (Windows users try [http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/ ActivePerl])
  * XML::TreePP module from cpan.org (cmd: cpan -i XML::TreePP)
  * Date::Parse module from cpan.org (cmd: cpan -i Date::Parse)

To run the script via the command line:
{{{
  $ ./xmltv2epg.pl xmltv.xml
}}} 
where xmltv.xml is the input XMLTV file containing TV guide data. An output file is created with the file name "ICE_EPG.DAT". Copy this file into the "/PVR/ICEEPG" directory on your PVR.

Sources for XMLTV data in Australia can be found on:
