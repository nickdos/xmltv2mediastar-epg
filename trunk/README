XMLTV2Mediastar-EPG
-------------------

This project started with a single Perl script that converts XMLTV data to
the EPG (electronic programme guide) data file format used by the Mediastar 
DT-920PVR and DT-820PVR.

The Perl script can be found in the Perl directory. A Java version is planned 
but has not been written yet.
