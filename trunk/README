XMLTV2Mediastar-EPG
-------------------

This project started with a single Perl script that converts XMLTV data to
the EPG (electronic programme guide) data file format used by the Mediastar 
DT-920PVR and DT-820PVR.

The Perl script can be found in the Perl directory. A Java version is planned 
but has not been written yet.

To use this script, run it via the command line with the XMLTV EPG file as the
only argument:

$ ./xmltv2epg.pl xmltv.xml

A file called "ICE_EPG.DAT" will be produced in the working directory, which
can be manually copied to the mediastar PVR (via the USB connection) into the 
directory called "ICEEPG".

If EPG data for some channels are not appearing on the PVR, it may be necessary
to edit the xmltv2epg.pl file and add a mapping between the channel id used in 
xmltv file and the channel numbers (LCN) used for the PVR. See the subroutine
called "get_lcn".
