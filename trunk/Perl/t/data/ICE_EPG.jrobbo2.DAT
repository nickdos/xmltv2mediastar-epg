2aagaiaiaiaaa0	3	0003,1283	09503	30	Global Village		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	Presented by Silvio Rivier. Accra - The Portuguese were the first to venture along the western coast of Africa in the 14th century in search of new riches. The first Portuguese caravel reached Ghana in 1471 and Elmina Castle was finished in 1481. It was built by 600 masons, carpenters and soldiers that were brought to Africa from Lisbon. The fortress covered 3,900 square metres and was equipped with living quarters, storerooms and canons. The Portuguese had negotiated a lease of the land with the local chieftains in return for their trade. Slaves were added to the list of goods and by 1600, 500 km of coastline was dotted with more than 60 fortresses built by a variety of nations wanting a piece of the trading pie. Today, the fortresses look somewhat out of place and they bear testimony to an inhumane trade. (From Germany, in German, with English subtitles and narration) (Rpt); The Singing Kite - A legend tells how, long ago, Thmen, the Cambodian national hero was imprisoned in China and owed his freedom to a large kite resembling a bird of prey that frightened the king. Today, after many years of war, Ang is reviving this traditional kite and has quite a following. (From France, in French and Khmer, with English subtitles and narration)

2aagaiaibadaa0	3	0003,1283	59483	60	Cutting Edge: AntiSemitism In The 21st 		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	Today, more than sixty years after the Holocaust, parts of the world are experiencing a dramatic resurgence of anti-Semitism - from hate-propaganda to vandalism to attacks on Jews themselves. This documentary explores the history and origins of anti-Semitism and looks at the reasons behind the new rise in anti-Semitism worldwide over the last few years. Reports from western watch groups such as the European Monitoring Centre on racism and xenophobia indicate a drastic increase in anti-Semitic incidents since the year 2000, especially in Europe, where the annual average number of anti-Semitic incidents has more than doubled since the 1990s. In addition, research shows that since the year 2000, an ever increasing number of anti-Semitic acts in parts of Europe, particularly in France and England, are being committed by Muslim and Arab youths who live there. Meanwhile, outside of Europe, in more and more Muslim communities around the world, there is an alarming increase in anti-Semitic rhetoric in the political and public arenas, especially in the mainstream media. What is fuelling this rise in anti-Semitism in the Islamic world today? What real threats does it pose? And how can history help us better understand what is happening?

2aagaiaibfeaa0	3	0003,1283	86508	115	Movie: It's Not Our Fault  (Ma Che Colp		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	A delightful ensemble piece following eight psychotherapy patients who continue to meet after their analyst has a coronary and dies in session. Realising that they need each other to relieve their solitary torments, and failing to find another therapist, they decide to try self-management with dismal results. Gegé (Carlo Verdone) remains a victim of his tyrannical factory-owner father; Luca (Max Amato), an over-intellectualised gay man, is unable to break away from his married lover; Flavia (Margherita Buy), desperately wanting a baby and remains hopelessly involved with a married man; Ernesto (Antonio Catania) keeps on riding night trains so as not to sleep in a serviced apartment; Chiara, afraid to love is still struggling with an eating disorder; Marco is unable to declare his love for her; Gabriella, incapable of coming to terms with the inevitability of ageing, continues to pay for sex; and a quiet religious musician can't leave his mother and move on. In a string of situations, the film follows the afflictions of each character individually, winding up with a weekend at a country retreat where, maybe thanks to the fresh air and a little help from a suspect herbal remedy, some gentle self-realisations are made. Also stars Anita Caprioli, Stefano Pesce, Lucia Sardo, Raquel Sueirio and directed by Carlo Verdone. (From Italy, in Italian, English subtitles)

2aagaiajbebaa0	3	0003,1283	96794	95	Movie: The Publisher  (Der Verleger)		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	This film is based on a biography of Axel Springer, who - from modest beginnings became post-war Europe's biggest newspaper publisher. Axel Springer (Heiner Lauterbach) founded his newspaper empire at the end of the Second World War. He was driven by the desire to provide the man in the street with easily digestible news in an easy-read format. Springer is probably best known for BILD, a tabloid that was filled with pictures and had minimal text. From there he branched out into a huge array of specialist and local newspapers and magazines. Although claiming not to be political, he constantly railed against the division of Germany and took an increasingly conservative attitude in his papers, which led the revolutionary youth of the sixties to attack the Springer press and Springer himself. The drama also provides glimpses of his private life. Married five times, he had a son, Axel Jr. and when Axel Jr. committed suicide in 1980, Springer retreated from public life. Written and directed by Bernd Böhlich and also stars Susanne Simon, Sylvester Groth, Anica Dobra and Jürgen Hentsch. The film received the 2001 Audience Award at the Baden-Baden TV Film Festival.

According to this documentary, Stalin liked to project an image of himself as a great military strategist, even calling himself 'Generalissimo' and constantly wearing military uniform. He is criticised as a warlord on several counts. First, he weakened the military during the Great Purge when, fearful of a coup, he had vast numbers of soldiers and top officers murdered. Secondly, he ordered a disastrous invasion of Finland, which resulted in a massive number of Soviet casualties. (From Germany, in German, Russian and Polish, English subtitles)

2aagaibaaiaaa0	3	0003,1283	09503	30	Global Village		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	Presented by Silvio Rivier. Willemstad - The town of Willemstad on the island of Curacao in the Caribbean was built by Jewish settlers in the style of the grand houses of Amsterdam. As the trans-shipment point for ships from Africa, Willemstad thrived because of the slave trade. After the abolition of slavery, business was based on the export of cotton, textiles, sugar and rum. The Dutch built a huge refinery which they then gave to the locals when it became outdated and revenue from the refinery still boosts the economy to this day. However, tourism now drives the town and the grand old Dutch mansions are being restored and painted in bright tropical colours. As Curacao is a tax haven, there are plenty of well-heeled business people just ready and waiting to move in. (From Germany, in German, with English subtitles and narration) (Rpt); The North Cemetery - In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, nearly a thousand inhabitants live in the North Cemetery, the city's largest necropolis. The living inhabitants are paid to look after the tombs owned by the rich families of the dead. The alleys of the cemetery resemble the streets of a poor district of the city and many of the residents were born here and are very dedicated to the families who employ them.

2aagaibabadaa0	3	0003,1283	26076	60	Storyline Australia: The Buchenwald Bal		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	Each year, on April 11, the anniversary of their liberation from Buchenwald Concentration Camp, a group of seventy and eighty-something men, hold a ball that celebrates life and is a testament to their determination to survive. The program recalls how, after their liberation, a group of forty-five orphan refugees settled in Melbourne. They formed a group, known as the Buchenwald Boys and became like each other's family. In 2005, filmmaker Danny Ben-Moshe followed some of the Boys in the lead-up to the 60th anniversary ball of their liberation from Buchenwald. Four of the Boys - Szaja Chaskiel, the President of the Boys Executive Committee, Sam Michalowicz, Henry Salter and Joe Szwarcberg share their stories both before and after their liberation. As filming began, Szaja's wife passed away and Jewish law forbids children of the deceased to listen to music for one year. Contentiously, Szaja refuses to have music at the ball so that his children can attend. Robust discussion ensues between the Boys, who are torn between wanting to respect Jewish custom and ensuring the ball is the vibrant celebration they crave - full of music and dance which are the symbolic elements that underpin their survival.

2aagaibbaeaaa0	3	0003,1283	82145	60	Documentary: On The Trail Of The Nabata		1	1	1	1	1	1	9	Petra, in modern-day Jordan, is a World Heritage listed site where incredible monuments, dwellings and tombs have been cut out of towering sheer cliff-faces. This program follows an archaeological team as they explore this ancient city that was the capital of the Nabataeans, an ancient nomadic people whose earliest settlements were in southern Jordan and Israel. From the Greek, the word Petra literally means 'rock.' The word is fitting: the monuments and tombs of the city have been literally cut from existing, natural rock formations. Indeed, it is the marvellous rock-carving skills of the Nabataeans - which required both strength and finesse - that have left the most enduring impression on the modern world. Their city and legacy has inspired and intrigued artists, archaeologists and filmmakers alike - Steven Spielberg used an elaborately-carved facade in one of Petra's monumental rock faces as settings used in his 1989 film Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, starring Harrison Ford.

This two-part film is set in August, 1952. Sir Jack Drummond, an eminent English scientist, his wife and 10-year-old daughter are murdered, shot down one night as they are camping on a remote farm in Provence, Grande-Terre. The farm belongs to Gaston Dominci (Michel Serrault), a 75-year-old man who rules over his household with an iron fist. The police, alerted by a passer-by, find nothing to suggest who might have carried out the massacre, or why, but Superintendent Sébeille (Michel Blanc) soon becomes convinced Gaston Dominici is involved. Yet, for one journalist, Lukas Fabre (Thomas Jouannet), the inquiry's inconsistencies, the lack of evidence and Gaston's apparent absence of motive points to a different theory. Directed by Pierre Boutron and also stars Bruno Slagmulder, Julie Delarme and Vincent Martin. (From France, in French, English subtitles)

Framed by the Lincoln Memorial speech and his assassination in Memphis, Tennessee, Citizen King traces King's effort to recast himself by embracing causes beyond the civil rights movement - to transform and re-structure the whole of American society as he put it. In this brief five-year span, his decision would alienate many of his closest friends and further inflame his enemies. As he began to speak out against the war in Vietnam and refashion himself as the leader of a crusade on behalf of the poor and dispossessed in America, King was accused of abandoning his mission. Citizen King shows how, in his crusade for economic justice and an end to war, King found himself at odds not only with white American leadership, but also with many influential black leaders. However, according to this film, he remained steadfast in his profound spiritual commitment to the human rights of all people and to the way of non-violence and creative peacemaking.
